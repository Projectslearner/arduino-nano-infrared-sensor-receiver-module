# Infrared Sensor Receiver Module

#### Project Overview

The Infrared Sensor Receiver Module project demonstrates how to interface an infrared (IR) receiver module with an Arduino Nano to detect IR signals from remote controls or other IR transmitters. This project utilizes the IRremote library to decode the IR signals and print the received IR codes to the serial monitor.

#### Components Needed

1. **Arduino Nano**
2. **Infrared Receiver Module (e.g., TSOP38238)**
3. **Jumper Wires**

### Block diagram


#### Circuit Setup

1. **Connect Infrared Receiver Module to Arduino Nano:**
   - Connect the output pin of the infrared receiver module to digital pin 11 (or any other digital pin you prefer) on the Arduino Nano.
   - Connect the VCC pin of the infrared receiver module to the 5V pin on the Arduino Nano.
   - Connect the GND pin of the infrared receiver module to the GND pin on the Arduino Nano.

#### Instructions

1. **Circuit Setup:**
   - Wire the infrared receiver module to the Arduino Nano as described in the circuit setup section.

2. **Library Installation:**
   - Install the IRremote library in the Arduino IDE. Go to Sketch -> Include Library -> Manage Libraries, then search for "IRremote" and install it.

3. **Code Upload:**
   - Connect the Arduino Nano to your computer via USB.
   - Open the Arduino IDE and paste the provided code.
   - Upload the code to the Arduino Nano.

4. **Testing:**
   - Once the code is uploaded, open the serial monitor.
   - Point an IR remote control towards the infrared receiver module and press any button.
   - Observe the hexadecimal code corresponding to the pressed button printed on the serial monitor.

#### Applications

- **Remote Control Interfacing:** Use the infrared receiver module to control devices or systems remotely using IR remote controls.
- **Home Automation:** Incorporate IR receivers into home automation projects to enable remote control functionality.
- **Security Systems:** Integrate IR receivers for detecting signals from IR-based security sensors or remote controls in security systems.

#### Notes

- Ensure that the IR receiver module is properly connected and aligned with the IR transmitter (e.g., remote control) for reliable signal reception.
- Experiment with different IR remote controls and observe the corresponding hexadecimal codes printed on the serial monitor for each button press.
